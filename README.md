Data model was included to create relationship between the primary and foreign keys to ensure data intergrity.
I proceeded in creating my pivot tables that gave different analysis on tables that will appear on the dashboard. the top five products that maintain the highest revenue are: clocks, cookware, ornament, phone and vases while the top ten states that maintain the highest revenue, population and median are California, New York, Texas and others.
